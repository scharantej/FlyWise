Certainly! Here's the design for a Flask application that enables tracking of flight prices from Hyderabad to Mumbai, selecting the lowest fare, and displaying the results:

## HTML Files

**1. index.html**
   - Home page: Contains a form for selecting the departure and arrival dates and a button to submit the search query.

**2. results.html**
   - Results page: Displays the list of available flights from Hyderabad to Mumbai, along with their prices and other relevant details.

## Routes

**1. @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**
   - This route serves the index.html page. It handles both GET and POST requests, with the GET request displaying the form and the POST request processing the user's search query.

**2. @app.route('/search', methods=['POST'])**
   - This route is triggered when the user submits the search form on the index.html page. It retrieves the departure and arrival dates from the form data and uses this information to query an external API or database to retrieve flight data. It then renders the results.html page, passing in the retrieved flight information.

## Implementation Details

- The Flask application can utilize a Python library like `requests` to communicate with the external API or database to retrieve flight data based on the user's search criteria.
- The `index.html` and `results.html` files can be designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface.
- The Flask application should include error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during API calls or data processing.
- Consider incorporating pagination to manage the display of results if the number of flights returned is extensive.

This design provides a basic structure for the Flask application and can be further expanded upon to meet additional requirements or enhance user experience.
